# AdelieOS 
AdelieOS is an Arch based Linux distribution designed to provide all the wonderful features of Arch in a more stable, user friendly distribution.

Core features of AdelieOS will include:

- A complete ready to install distribution with the Calamares installer.
- AdelieOS uses its own repositories which allows for more testing of package updates before being pushed to users.
- Custom simplified package manager based on pacman which provides more intuitive options for installing, removing, and searching packages.
- Beautifully configured desktop environment right out of the box.
- Convenient safe installation of popular Linux applications not available in the Arch Linux official repositories using the AdelieOS repo.

This list will be evolving and changing as time goes on, but these are our initial goals.

If you would like to contribute to AdelieOS, please contact the developers.

# Current Status of AdelieOS
AdelieOS is in its early stages of development. We plan to make an initial early development snapshot available for download on the adelieos.com website within the next few weeks, but you can clone the repository and build the iso for yourself if you are interested. 

# Building AdelieOS
Any Arch based system should be able to build the AdelieOS ISO image as long as both base-devel and archiso are installed. Simpley clone this repository and then execute the bldadelie.sh script located in the build directory. This script must be executed with root privileges.
