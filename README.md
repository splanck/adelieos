# adelieos
AdelieOS is an Arch based Linux distribution designed to provide all the wonderful features of Arch in a more stable, user friendly distribution.

Core features of AdelieOS will include:

- A complete ready to install distribution with the Calamares installer.
- AdelieOS uses its own repositories which allows for more testing of package updates before being pushed to users.
- Custom simplified package manager based on pacman which provides more intuitive options for installing, removing, and searching packages.
- Beautifully configured desktop environment right out of the box.
- Convenient safe installation of popular Linux applications not available in the Arch Linux official repositories using the AdelieOS repo.

This list will be evolving and changing as time goes on, but these are our initial goals.

If you would like to contribute to AdelieOS, please contact the developers.
