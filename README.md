# AdelieOS 
AdelieOS is an Arch based Linux distribution designed to provide all the wonderful features of Arch in a more stable, user friendly distribution.

Core features of AdelieOS will include:

- A complete ready to install distribution with the Calamares installer.
- AdelieOS uses its own repositories which allows for more testing of package updates before being pushed to users.
- Custom simplified package manager based on pacman which provides more intuitive options for installing, removing, and searching packages.
- Beautifully configured desktop environment right out of the box.
- Convenient safe installation of popular Linux applications not available in the Arch Linux official repositories using the AdelieOS repo.

This list will be evolving and changing as time goes on, but these are our initial goals.

# Current Status of AdelieOS
AdelieOS is in its early stages of development. We have made early development snapshots available for download on the https://adelieos.com website which provides a full working Arch based system with Calamares installer, but lacks most of the unique features that will be included in the final AdelieOS release. You can also clone the repository and build the iso for yourself based on the latest sources if you are interested. 

# Building AdelieOS
Any Arch based system should be able to build the AdelieOS ISO image as long as both base-devel and archiso are installed. Simply clone this repository and then execute the bldadelie.sh script located in the build directory. This script must be executed with root privileges. You can also build the ISO from source using AdelieOS itself by installing the it from the development snapshot image which includes all the dependencies required for the build process.

# Contributing to AdelieOS
We are always delighted to hear from anyone interested in getting involved and contributing to the project. The project team is currently very small and we have not yet finalized how we will organise community contributions, but there will be plenty of opportunities to contribute for individuals of all skill levels. If you are interested in getting involved with AdelieOS, please let us know what you'd like to contribute and where your interests are.

Thank you for your interest in the AdelieOS project.
